## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Strong in left and right brain thinking, I like to solve problems creatively and analytically. If it's a technical challenge, like where to start with a project using machine learning when it's new to the whole team, or a social issue we want to tackle with tech, like the unchecked misinformation of fake news, I get great pleasure working to find innovative solutions and learning things in the process.
