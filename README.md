I'm a Musician turned Software Engineer, gone from writing Radio X's Hot Track of the Week, to composing code. As a creative, continuous learning and making things is what fires me up. I am looking for work as a Full Stack Senior Software Engineer in an agile team, with a creative, social environment, making cool things that make people's lives better.

In my role at Cazoo, I have significantly enhanced my leadership and project management capabilities, consistently leading key projects and facilitating cross-functional team collaboration. My experience as a Tech Lead has deepened my expertise in software architecture and discovery, enabling me to re-architect systems for innovative product offerings. Additionally, I have honed my skills in stakeholder management and communication, effectively aligning commercial and third-party stakeholders to achieve project goals. These experiences have equipped me with a robust understanding of project dynamics and the ability to drive successful outcomes in a fast-paced, agile environment.
