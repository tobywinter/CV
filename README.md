Musician turned Developer, 5 months ago I made the choice to learn to code and use my skills for writing scores to compose programmes. As a creative, continuously learning and making things is what I love, so gaining the tools to do that in such an exciting industry with technology felt like coming home to me. I have experience in Marketing, PR, and Hospitality and have worked freelance as a Musician and Composer for the past 3 years out of University. I am looking for work as a Full Stack Junior Developer in an agile team, with a creative, social environment, making cool things that make peoples lives better.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Strong in left and right brain thinking, I like to solve problems creatively and analytically. Whether it's a technical challenge, or a social issue I get great pleasure working with people to find innovative solutions and learning things in the process.

- When building a facebook-style clone, our team decided we wanted to make something unique and tackle the problem of fake news, I took on this challenge with a pair, and after brainstorming, research and discussion, we constructed a elegant solution using data we had sourced to identify unreliable sites and sources when they were posted, and to flag them with a warning about the nature of that site.

#### Communication

As a creative 90% of the work is communication, all my time spent as a musician, writing music for young film makers projects and working on collaborative projects with bands has relied on understanding and aligning a shared vision.

- As a student I was elected President of the Southampton University: Showstoppers Musical Theatre Society, a challenge which greatly improved my leadership and taught me to manage a diverse team of strong characters.
- As Director of a production of The Graduate in the final year of my degree, working with actors, a tight knit production team, a tech team and the Theatre Group society, I translated my vision into reality and successful produced a profitable show over a two month period.

#### Quick Learner

During my career as a musician my desire to do bigger, better, and more authentic things has lead me to learn a great deal, including studying singing and teaching myself to play guitar, bass, piano, ukulele, clarinet, bassoon and studio engineering and production. My inclination to learn new things quickly, and put them into practice, helped me learn and develop with countless technologies in 12 weeks, and continues to do so.

- I learnt to play all the instruments I wanted to use in musician, so that I could write, play and record demos for tracks intended to be played by a full band.
- As a student on the Makers Academy 12 week course, I began with a very basic understanding of Ruby syntax, by the final week I have produced projects using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and Python.
